\title{Convert a Count Matrix into an Individual-Level Data Frame}
\usage{
y_to_data_frame(y, index = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Matrix. A matrix where each row corresponds to a specific category of
individuals, and each column represents a different dataset (e.g., different
simulations or different data sources). The matrix must have exactly six rows,
named as follows:
\describe{
\item{\code{"s1"}}{Count of verified true positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 1)}.}
\item{\code{"s2"}}{Count of verified false negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 1)}.}
\item{\code{"r1"}}{Count of verified false positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 0)}.}
\item{\code{"r2"}}{Count of verified true negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 0)}.}
\item{\code{"u1"}}{Count of unverified individuals who tested positive \eqn{(V = 0, T = 1, D = \text{NA})}.}
\item{\code{"u2"}}{Count of unverified individuals who tested negative \eqn{(V = 0, T = 0, D = \text{NA})}.}
}
The column(s) of \code{y} can contain multiple datasets, where each column
corresponds to a different data instance (e.g., different simulations or subsets).}

\item{index}{Integer. The column index in \code{y} to be converted into an
individual-level data frame. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{verification}}{Binary indicator: \eqn{1} if the individual was verified, \eqn{0} otherwise.}
\item{\code{test}}{Binary indicator: \eqn{1} if the diagnostic test was positive, \eqn{0} if negative.}
\item{\code{disease}}{Binary indicator: \eqn{1} if the individual has the disease, \eqn{0} if not, \code{NA} if unverified.}
}

Each row corresponds to an individual, and the total number of rows matches the
sum of counts in the selected column of \code{y}.
}
\description{
This function transforms a matrix containing counts of individuals categorized
by verification status, test result, and disease status into an expanded data
frame where each row represents an individual.

\examples{
# Example with a count matrix
y <- matrix(c(50, 30, 20, 40, 60, 100), ncol = 1,
            dimnames = list(c("s1", "s2", "r1", "r2", "u1", "u2"), "dataset1"))

# Convert the data into an individual-level format
df <- y_to_data_frame(y, index = 1)
