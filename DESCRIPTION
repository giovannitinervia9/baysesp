Description: 
    `baysesp` is an R package that provides Bayesian methods for estimating the sensitivity 
    and specificity of diagnostic tests in the presence of verification bias. It allows users 
    to incorporate prior information and obtain posterior distributions of test performance 
    metrics using Bayesian inference. The package includes functions for data simulation, 
    model fitting via Stan, and posterior summarization, facilitating robust and flexible 
    analysis of diagnostic test accuracy.
