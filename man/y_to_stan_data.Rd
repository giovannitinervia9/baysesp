\title{Convert a Count Matrix to a Named List for \code{baysesp()}}
\usage{
y_to_stan_data(y, index = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Matrix. A numeric matrix where each row represents a count category,
and each column corresponds to a different dataset (e.g., different simulations or
different data sources). The matrix must have exactly six rows
with the following names:
\describe{
\item{\code{"s1"}}{Count of verified true positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 1)}.}
\item{\code{"s2"}}{Count of verified false negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 1)}.}
\item{\code{"r1"}}{Count of verified false positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 0)}.}
\item{\code{"r2"}}{Count of verified true negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 0)}.}
\item{\code{"u1"}}{Count of unverified individuals who tested positive \eqn{(V = 0, T = 1, D = \text{NA})}.}
\item{\code{"u2"}}{Count of unverified individuals who tested negative \eqn{(V = 0, T = 0, D = \text{NA})}.}
}

The function assumes that row names are assigned to ensure correct mapping of
elements. If row names are missing, it will assign default names.}

\item{index}{Integer. The column index in \code{y} to be extracted and converted
into a named list. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A named list containing the counts for each category. If row names are
missing, the function assigns default names ("s1", "s2", "r1", "r2", "u1", "u2")
in order.
}
\description{
This function converts a matrix containing diagnostic test data into a named
list format suitable for use in \code{baysesp()}. It extracts the data for a specified
column index and returns it as a list with named elements corresponding to different
diagnostic test outcome categories.
}
\examples{
# Example count matrix with named rows
y <- matrix(c(50, 30, 20, 40, 60, 100), ncol = 1,
            dimnames = list(c("s1", "s2", "r1", "r2", "u1", "u2"), "dataset1"))

# Convert the first column to a Stan-compatible list
stan_data <- y_to_stan_data(y, index = 1)
