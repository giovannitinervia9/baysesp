\title{Convert Individual-Level Data Frame to Count-Based List for Stan}
\usage{
data_frame_to_stan_data(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame. A dataset where each row represents an individual and includes
the following binary-coded columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{verification}}{Indicator for whether the disease status was verified (\eqn{1} = verified, \eqn{0} = not verified).}
\item{\code{test}}{Indicator for test result (\eqn{1} = positive, \eqn{0} = negative).}
\item{\code{disease}}{Indicator for disease presence (\eqn{1} = has disease, \eqn{0} = no disease).}
}}
}
\value{
A named list containing counts of individuals in different verification, test, and disease status categories:
\describe{
\item{\code{"s1"}}{Count of verified true positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 1)}.}
\item{\code{"s2"}}{Count of verified false negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 1)}.}
\item{\code{"r1"}}{Count of verified false positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 0)}.}
\item{\code{"r2"}}{Count of verified true negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 0)}.}
\item{\code{"u1"}}{Count of unverified individuals who tested positive \eqn{(V = 0, T = 1, D = \text{NA})}.}
\item{\code{"u2"}}{Count of unverified individuals who tested negative \eqn{(V = 0, T = 0, D = \text{NA})}.}
}
}
\description{
This function processes a data frame containing individual-level diagnostic test data
and converts it into a named list of counts, structured for use in Bayesian modeling
(e.g., with Stan). The input data frame must include three binary columns:
\code{verification}, \code{test}, and \code{disease}.

# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  verification = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0),
  test         = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0),
  disease      = c(1, 1, 0, 0, NA, NA, 1, NA, 0, NA)
)

# Convert to Stan-compatible count list
