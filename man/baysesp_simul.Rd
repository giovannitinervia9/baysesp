\title{Simulate Diagnostic Test Data with Verification Bias}
\usage{
baysesp_simul(
  n = 100,
  nsim = 1,
  p = 0.01,
  se = 0.8,
  sp = 0.9,
  l11 = 0.8,
  l21 = 0.3,
  l12 = 0.4,
  l22 = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. The total number of observations to simulate. Default is 100.}

\item{nsim}{Integer. The number of simulation replicates. Default is 1.}

\item{p}{Numeric. The prevalence of the disease in the population. Default is 0.01.}

\item{se}{Numeric. The sensitivity of the diagnostic test, defined as
\eqn{P(T = 1 | D = 1)}.}

\item{sp}{Numeric. The specificity of the diagnostic test, defined as
\eqn{P(T = 0 | D = 0)}.}

\item{l11}{Numeric. Probability of verification given a positive test result
and a positive disease status, defined as \eqn{P(V = 1 | T = 1, D = 1)}.}

\item{l21}{Numeric. Probability of verification given a positive test result
and a negative disease status, defined as \eqn{P(V = 1 | T = 1, D = 0)}.}

\item{l12}{Numeric. Probability of verification given a negative test result
and a positive disease status, defined as \eqn{P(V = 1 | T = 0, D = 1)}.}

\item{l22}{Numeric. Probability of verification given a negative test result
and a negative disease status, defined as \eqn{P(V = 1 | T = 0, D = 0)}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of counts with 6 rows and \code{nsim} columns.
The rows represent:
\itemize{
\item \code{"s1"}: Verified true positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 1)}
\item \code{"s2"}: Verified false negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 1)}
\item \code{"r1"}: Verified false positives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 1, D = 0)}
\item \code{"r2"}: Verified true negatives \eqn{(V = 1, T = 0, D = 0)}
\item \code{"u1"}: Unverified test positives \eqn{(V = 0, T = 1, D = NA)}
\item \code{"u2"}: Unverified test negatives \eqn{(V = 0, T = 0, D = NA)}
}
}
\description{
This function generates simulated diagnostic test data incorporating
verification bias. It uses multinomial sampling to create data based on
specified sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and verification probabilities.
